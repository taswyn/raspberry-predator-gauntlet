from: https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Runcommand/#runcommand-onstart-and-runcommand-onend-scripts
Runcommand can execute an user script before the game launching (runcommand-onstart.sh) and after exiting the emulator (runcommand-onend.sh). Both scripts must be placed at /opt/retropie/configs/all/.

Useful data are passed as arguments to these scripts:

$1 - the system (eg: atari2600, nes, snes, megadrive, fba, etc).
$2 - the emulator (eg: lr-stella, lr-fceumm, lr-picodrive, pifba, etc).
$3 - the full path to the rom file.
$4 - the full command line used to launch the emulator.
